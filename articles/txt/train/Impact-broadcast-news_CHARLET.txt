tion on the ETAPE TV evaluation subset for the different systems consists in building an agglomerative clustering of speech segments
(ofﬁcial submissions to the ETAPE evaluation in bold). based on Bayesian Information Criterion (where each cluster is mod-
eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

with different overlapping speech detection systems, when includ-

tion on the ETAPE TV evaluation subset for the different systems consists in building an agglomerative clustering of speech segments
(ofﬁcial submissions to the ETAPE evaluation in bold). based on Bayesian Information Criterion (where each cluster is mod-
eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

with different overlapping speech detection systems, when includ-

tion on the ETAPE TV evaluation subset for the different systems consists in building an agglomerative clustering of speech segments
(ofﬁcial submissions to the ETAPE evaluation in bold). based on Bayesian Information Criterion (where each cluster is mod-
eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

with different overlapping speech detection systems, when includ-

threshold Ts. For comparison, the baseline system processes the

tion on the ETAPE TV evaluation subset for the different systems consists in building an agglomerative clustering of speech segments
(ofﬁcial submissions to the ETAPE evaluation in bold). based on Bayesian Information Criterion (where each cluster is mod-
eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

(ofﬁcial submissions to the ETAPE evaluation in bold). based on Bayesian Information Criterion (where each cluster is mod-
eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

(ofﬁcial submissions to the ETAPE evaluation in bold). based on Bayesian Information Criterion (where each cluster is mod-
eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

tion on the ETAPE TV evaluation subset for the different systems consists in building an agglomerative clustering of speech segments
(ofﬁcial submissions to the ETAPE evaluation in bold). based on Bayesian Information Criterion (where each cluster is mod-
eled by a single Gaussian with a full covariance matrix). When each
cluster contains enough data to model the voice more precisely, the
clusters are modeled with Gaussians mixture, and the agglomerative
clustering is pursued with a distance between clusters based on a
cross-likelihood criterion. At each iteration of the clustering based
on cross-likelihood, a Viterbi decoding is also performed to reseg-
ment the speech data into speaker turns, given the new clusters.

with different overlapping speech detection systems, when includ-

threshold Ts. For comparison, the baseline system processes the

tems apply the overlap exclusion step, and the proposed new label-
